# VisualAudio.info-MIDI


Visual Audio is a language which maps music into visuals with the aim of augmenting the Deaf community's experience of music. Our software aims to provide real-time visualisation of music.

**Contents**

MidiThru is a simple MIDI application which plays MIDI input to your speakers
VCTRLv1.5.exe is an app which sends Midi data to flash
Menu.swf is the VA main menu and will load up the other swfs as needed


**Instructions**

All three applications must be running for visualisations to work.


**Please note:** the original source code for this project was lost in a tragic event I've called "the great hard drive crash of 2006". I lost a tonne of work and photos so only the final application is available here.
