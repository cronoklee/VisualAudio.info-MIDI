# VisualAudio.info-MIDI


Visual Audio is a language which maps music into visuals with the aim of augmenting the Deaf community's experience of music. This software aims to provide real-time visualisation of music.

**Contents**

* VCTRLv1.5.exe is an app which sends incoming Midi to flash

* Menu.swf is the VA main menu and it will load up the other swfs as needed

* MidiThru is a simple MIDI application which plays MIDI input to your speakers (optional)



**Instructions**

* Download all contents of this repository to a sensible location (You can't easily move it later)
* Download the "standalone" Flash player for your operating system half way down this page:  https://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer.html. 
* Run Flash player and open Menu.swf in it
* When the security warning appears, click settings>security and add the folder where you downloaded VisualAudio to the "trusted locations". (If you move VisualAudio later, you'll need to do this step again.)
* Restart Flash player and open Menu.swf again.
* Run VCTRLv1.5.exe, Choose a MIDI device and click start to begin transmitting incoming MIDI from it.
* Choose a visualisation from the VA Menu screen and start playing!
* Note: VA does not play music. To hear what you're playing while you see it, you'll need MidiThru or a similar real-time MIDI player.

**Please note:** the original source code for this project was lost in a tragic event I've dubbed "the great hard drive crash of 2006". I lost a tonne of work and photos so only the final application is available here.
